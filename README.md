# Login-Register-PHP
Register and Login system with Notifications done with PHP and AJAX

Every action is being notified to user and saved in database.

Right now it covers levels of notification (success, warning, error...etc), info of the notification, user which done that action, ip from where it came and a timestamp. Also you can list all notifications and filter them.

New user will require approval currently, will implement options for this.
So someone how can login can currently approve, there is no user levels added yet.
Every action is logged and we can filter notifications by user, level, module and date.(on screenshot there is only dashboard page shown, this is on other dedicated for notifications with the idea of "9000 level" access to it....when privleges are implemented).

This is user approval and dashboard pages.

Every user can set their own theme for app, right now only dark and light(which is inverted dark, didn't had time)...second 2 options are just placeholders right now.
