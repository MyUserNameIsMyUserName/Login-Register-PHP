# Login-Register-PHP
Register and Login system with Notifications done with PHP and AJAX

Every action is being notified to user and saved in database.

Right now it covers levels of notification (success, warning, error...etc), info of the notification, user which done that action, ip from where it came and a timestamp. Also you can list all notifications and filter them.
